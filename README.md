# Math Expression Simplifying Program

## Project Description

This program is a term rewriting program which repeatedly applies all the available rules to the expression being simplified. The rules are maintained in a rule book, which can be edited by the user. The program also comes with the capabilities of allowing the user to add and delete rules. 

A sample run of the program is presented here. The user just entered `d/dx(d/dx(x^3))` and the program showed the simplified result.

The program can also save the results in a file. Here is a part of the answer file generated from the sample questions available with the program and demostrates the program's capability of boolean simplification when the rulebook is changed.

    Q. - ( y + x * y + - ( x ) + ( - ( x ) ) * y )
    
    Absorption Laws
    = - ( y + x * y + - ( x ) )
    
    Absorption Laws
    = - ( y + - ( x ) )
    
    DeMorgan's Theorem
    = ( - ( y ) ) * ( - ( - ( x ) ) )
    
    Involution
    = ( - ( y ) ) * x


## Getting started 
This program is designed to run on TurboC++ compiler and has been tested to run successfully on compiler version 3.2. Download the Turbo C++ compiler from [its website.](https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/)

Then, move the files inside the `program` folder inside the `bin` folder located in the Turbo C++ directory, which is by default in `C:` for Windows users. The program can then be opened and run inside the Turbo C++ IDE.

## File Information
* `MATH.CPP` contains the program
* `Q.txt` contains sample questions
* `RULEBOOK.TXT` contains the rules for arithmetic and algebraic simplification.
* `BOOLRULE.TXT` contains the rules for boolean simplification.

Instructions on operating the program and available within the program itself.

## Solution Implementation
The algorithm implemented for expression re-writing is based on matching and replacing parts of expressions. Numerous functions use several algorithms to achieve their task and some of the noteworthy techniques are presented as follows:

* Dijsktraâ€™s shunting yard algorithm for conversion into postfix
* File manipulation: creating, deleting, writing, appending, traversing
* Recursive function for calculating HCF
* Push and pop operations on a stack
* Window-like user interface with enter-less input functionality
* Pausing bulk writing on the screen when text content start to move out of view
